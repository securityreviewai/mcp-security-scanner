# MCP Security Profiler

A CLI tool for scanning GitHub repositories for security issues. This tool provides an extensible framework for analyzing GitHub repositories with customizable scanning logic and multiple report formats.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Token Management**: GitHub personal access token stored securely in user config
- üîç **Repository Scanning**: Clone and analyze GitHub repositories
- üìä **Multiple Report Formats**: Generate reports in JSON and Markdown formats
- üîß **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add custom scanning logic
- üöÄ **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface with progress indicators
- üßπ **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary repositories cleaned up after scanning

## Installation

This project uses `uv` as the package manager. Make sure you have `uv` installed:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mcp-security-profiler
uv sync
```

### MCP Server Dependencies

The scanner uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for advanced code analysis:

- **ast-grep-mcp**: Pattern-based code search and analysis
- **xray-mcp**: Code structure analysis

These MCP servers are automatically installed and managed via `uvx` when you run a scan - no manual installation is required. The scanner will:
1. Download and cache the MCP servers on first use
2. Run them in isolated environments
3. Automatically reuse cached versions on subsequent scans

**Note**: The first scan may take slightly longer as MCP servers are being installed in the background.

## Setup

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your values:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Token

Before using the scanner, you need to configure your GitHub personal access token:

```bash
uv run mcp-security-profiler config --token <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

Or let it prompt you:

```bash
uv run mcp-security-profiler config
```

**Creating a GitHub Token:**

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (for private repos) or `public_repo` (for public repos only)
4. Generate and copy the token

The token is stored securely in `~/.mcp-security-profiler/config.json` with restricted permissions.

## Usage

### Scan a Repository

```bash
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan <REPOSITORY>
```

The `REPOSITORY` argument accepts multiple formats:
- Full URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- Short format: `owner/repo`
- Git URL: `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`

### Options

```bash
# Generate specific report formats
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan owner/repo --format json
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan owner/repo --format markdown
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan owner/repo --format json --format markdown

# Specify output directory
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan owner/repo --output-dir ./my-reports
```

### Examples

```bash
# Scan a public repository
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan django/django

# Scan with custom output directory
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan https://github.com/pallets/flask --output-dir ./flask-scan

# Generate only JSON report
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan owner/repo -f json
```

## Report Formats

### JSON Report

The JSON report contains structured data including:
- Repository metadata
- Scan timestamp and ID
- Detailed findings with severity levels
- Repository statistics
- Summary with finding counts by severity

### Markdown Report

The Markdown report provides a human-readable format with:
- Repository information
- Visual summary tables
- Findings grouped by severity
- Recommendations for each finding
- File type distribution statistics

## Customizing the Scanner

The scanner is designed to be extensible. You can add your custom scanning logic by modifying the `Scanner` class in `mcp_security_profiler/scanner.py`.

### Adding Custom Scans

Edit the `_run_custom_scans()` method to add your custom scanning logic:

```python
def _run_custom_scans(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    findings = []
    
    # Add your custom scanning logic here
    findings.extend(self._scan_for_secrets())
    findings.extend(self._scan_dependencies())
    findings.extend(self._scan_code_quality())
    findings.extend(self._scan_configurations())
    
    return findings
```

### Example Custom Scanner Methods

```python
def _scan_for_secrets(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Scan for hardcoded secrets."""
    findings = []
    # Your implementation here
    return findings

def _scan_dependencies(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Scan for vulnerable dependencies."""
    findings = []
    # Your implementation here
    return findings
```

## Development

### Running from Source

```bash
# Run the CLI
uv run python main.py config
uv run python main.py scan owner/repo

# Or use the installed script
uv run mcp-security-profiler --help
```

### Adding Dependencies

Use `uv add` to add new dependencies:

```bash
uv add package-name
```

## CLI Commands

### `config`

Configure GitHub token for API access.

```bash
uv run mcp-security-profiler config --token <TOKEN>
```

**Options:**
- `--token`: GitHub personal access token (prompted if not provided)

### `scan`

Scan a GitHub repository for security issues.

```bash
uv run mcp-security-profiler scan REPOSITORY [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `REPOSITORY`: GitHub repository (URL or owner/repo format)

**Options:**
- `-f, --format [json|markdown]`: Report format (can specify multiple, default: both)
- `-o, --output-dir PATH`: Output directory for reports (default: ./scan-results)

## Security Notes

- GitHub tokens are stored with `0600` permissions (owner read/write only)
- Configuration directory: `~/.mcp-security-profiler/`
- Temporary repositories are cleaned up by default
- All GitHub API access uses authenticated requests

## Troubleshooting

### Token Issues

If you get authentication errors:
1. Verify your token is valid
2. Reconfigure: `uv run mcp-security-profiler config`
3. Ensure token has appropriate scopes

### Cloning Issues

If repository cloning fails:
- Check your network connection
- Verify you have access to the repository
- For private repos, ensure token has `repo` scope

### Report Generation

If reports are not generated:
- Check write permissions in output directory
- Verify output path is valid
- Check disk space
